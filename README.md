# Html Link tool - htmllinktool.exe

This is a command line tool that checks that html links have valid targets.

This Tool is in the early stages of development so is incomplete but works to some extent. I am using it to convert from a large mackdown document to a html document with the same link structure so this tool is being added to and used activly.
